CppUnit - The C++ Unit Test Library
===================================

CppUnit is the C++ port of the famous JUnit framework for unit testing.

This is a fork of the original CPPUnit library, cloned from the original svn
repository (which was apparently forked from a CVS repository).

I will accept patches to this version of CPPUnit and, if sufficient new
features or bugfixes warrant it, release a new version as CPPUnit-forked.

I do not intend to go on any large coding binges: CPPUnit has been stable and
usable for many years, and I have no intention of changing that - I just intend
to allow improving on it.

For MSWindows installation notes, see INSTALL-WIN32.txt. For other systems --
including cygwin -- see INSTALL and INSTALL-unix.

Bug reports are welcome. Please use the GitHub issues and pull request system
for that. Bugs that already appear in the file BUGS do not need to be reported.
